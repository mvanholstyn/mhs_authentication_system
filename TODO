Replaces SHA1 with SecureRandom

Overall
 ! Add Tests

Controller
 ? Update how restrict_to works so that it can be ignored in subclasses

Model
 ? Allow custom validation msg for role and priv validations
 ! Revisit mixin for role/priv/role_priv/forgot_pass/forgot_pass_mailer

Ideas
 * Signup hooks and options
 * Account activation
 * Object level privileges
 * Attribute level privileges
 ? controller/action privileges
 * Profile options
 * Preferences system
 ? view helpers (link_to, form_for, etc...)
 ? Syntax for asking for permission a & b (not just or)
 ? Users can belong to many roles
 ? can_xxx? helpers for privileges

Object level privileges
	http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/scoped_access

Remember Me/Signup/Forgot Password/Activation

Privilege Syntax
  http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/simple_access_control
    uses "admin || manager" style syntax
    adds has_permission? helper on view

  http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/acl_system2/
    uses "admin || manager" style syntax
    adds has_permission? helper on view

Privilege
  http://activeacl.rubyforge.org/
    has object level permissions
    you can explicitely deny users privileges (not sure if i like this)
    seems very complex, and the API does not seem very easy
